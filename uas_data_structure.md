# Macrosystems UAS Data Structure

To create the standardized Macrosystems UAS Data Structure, put the shell script [create_macro_plot_data_file_structure.sh](https://github.com/earthlab/macrosystems_fieldwork_hub/blob/main/create_macro_plot_data_file_structure.sh) in the directory where you would like to create your plot subdirectory.

When you run this shell script, you will be asked for a few pieces of standardized information. From this user-supplied information, the script will generate the full structure outlined below.
